# AutoComplete Elastic search
### ~ Let's Begin with Elastic search

## Inspiration
Didn't know about this Technology before !
Thankyou CodeForCause for conducting hackathon which helped a lot to explore in different IT aspects

## What it does
It gives an automatic recommendation whatever we search for (Which follows the dataset)

## How I built it
I have used flask for Backend and for cloud server end i hav eused Elastic search, kibana and logstash

## Challenges I ran into
As I developed this project alone with no prior knowledge so initially it was very difficult for me...but documentation really helped me to solve all of my basics doubts

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learned and explored new technologies...and successfully able to find and filter a dataset using Logstash


## What learned
-Elastic search engine
-Querying data from logstash

## What's next for Auto complete Elastic Search
Automatic movie recommendation by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
